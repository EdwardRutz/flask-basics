# Flask Basics Notes


- View: "A view is a function that returns an HTTP response. This response has to be a string but can be any string you want."
  - Other frameworks call Views Controllers.
- Route: "A route is the URL path to a view. They always start with a forward slash / and can end with one if you want."
- dunder: "A quick way of saying "double underscore".
